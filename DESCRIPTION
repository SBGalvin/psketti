Title: Generating Investigatory Plots and Tables for Rasch Analysis
Version: 0.1.1
Author: Shane B. Galvin
Maintainer: Shane B. Galvin <sbmgalvin@gmail.com>
Description: psketti generates investigatory plots and tables to assist in
    Rasch Analysis by using a number of accessor, table, and plotting functions.
    Data are extracted from dichotmous (RM) and partial credit (PCM) Rasch
    models fitted by Conditional Maximum Likelihood (CML) estimation in the eRm
    package. Empirical Item Characteristic Curves (ICC) are computed by dividing
    the latent dimension into class intervals in which the frequency of response
    to a category is counted and presented as a proportion of that class
    interval. Confidence Intervals for the Empirical ICC are also calculated.
    Infit and Outfit measures are also extracted for presentation as a simple
    diagnostic plot. Plots are compiled using ggplot2.
